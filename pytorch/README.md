From a machine learning perspective, these models represent a beginner to intermediate level of ML implementation. Here's why:
# Model Types Used:
These are all supervised learning problems
They cover both classification (iris, wine quality) and regression (housing prices)
They use relatively straightforward algorithms (likely Random Forests, Linear Regression, or similar basic models)


# Complexity Level:
## Basic:
Single models (not ensembles)
Tabular data (no images, text, or complex data types)
Structured datasets that are well-known and clean
Direct input-output relationships

## Missing Advanced Elements:
No deep learning
No natural language processing
No computer vision
No time series analysis
No reinforcement learning
No advanced model architectures
# Educational Value:
These models are perfect for learning because they:
Cover fundamental ML concepts
Use well-understood datasets
Demonstrate both classification and regression
Are easy to validate and interpret
Show practical deployment in a web application
# Real-World Context:
While these are learning examples, they do represent real-world use cases:
Housing price prediction is a common real estate application
Wine quality assessment is used in food & beverage industry
Classification tasks like iris are similar to many industrial sorting/categorization problems

# To make this more advanced, you could consider:
Adding feature engineering
Implementing model ensembles
Adding cross-validation
Including hyperparameter tuning
Adding more complex data preprocessing
Implementing A/B testing
Adding model monitoring and retraining capabilities
Including more complex models like neural networks
Adding unsupervised learning components

## Iris Dataset Model

The Iris dataset model requires a pre-trained checkpoint to run tests. You can either:

1. Download the pre-trained model:
   ```bash
   # Add download command here
   ```

2. Or train the model yourself:
   ```bash
   python -m pytorch.neural_networks.iris_dataset.train_model
   ```

Note: The model is configured to achieve >95% accuracy on the test set for educational purposes. In real-world applications, 90%+ accuracy is typically considered good for the Iris dataset.
